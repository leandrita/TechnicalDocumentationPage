          <h3>What is Angular</h3>
        </header>
          <p>Angular is a development platform, built on <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a></p>
         <p>As a platform, Angular includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
              <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
              <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
            </ul>
          <p>When you build applications with Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as easy as possible, so you can take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.</p>

          <h3>What you'll build</h3>
        </header>
          <p>This tutorial series guides you through building a to-do list application. Via this application you'll learn how to use Angular to manage, edit, add, delete, and filter items.</p>

          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        </header>
          <p>To install Angular on your local system, you need the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Node.js Angular requires a current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. For information about specific version requirements, see the engines key in the package.json file. For more information on installing Node.js, see nodejs.org. If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run node -v in a terminal window.</li>
            <li>npm package manager Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal window.</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Set_up_your_application">
        <header>
          <h3>Set up your application</h3>
        </header>
          <p>You can use the Angular CLI to run commands in your terminal for generating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. To install the Angular CLI, run the following command in your terminal:</p>
          <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
          <p>Angular CLI commands all start with ng, followed by what you'd like the CLI to do. In the Desktop directory, use the following ng new command to create a new application called todo:</p>
          <code>ng new todo --routing=false --style=css</code>
          <p>The ng new command creates a minimal starter Angular application on your Desktop. The additional flags, <code>--routing</code> and <code>--style</code>, define how to handle navigation and styles in the application. This tutorial describes these features later in more detail.</p>
          <p>If you are prompted to enforce stricter type checking, you can respond with yes.</p>
          <p>Navigate into your new project with the following cd command:</p>
          <code>cd todo</code>
          <p>To run your todo application, use ng serve:</p>
          <code>ng serve</code>
          <p>When the CLI prompts you about analytics, answer no.</p>
          <p>In the browser, navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to see your new starter application. If you change any of the source files, the application automatically reloads.

</p>
          <p>While ng serve is running, you might want to open a second terminal tab or window in order to run commands. If at any point you would like to stop serving your application, press Ctrl+c while in the terminal.</p>

          <h3>Get familiar with your Angular application</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The application source files that this tutorial focuses on are in src/app. Key files that the CLI generates automatically include the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>app.module.ts: Specifies the files that the application uses. This file acts as a central hub for the other files in your application.</li>
          <li>app.component.ts: Also known as the class, contains the logic for the application's main page.</li>
          <li>app.component.html: Contains the HTML for AppComponent. The contents of this file are also known as the template. The template determines the view or what you see in the browser.</li>
          <li>app.component.css: Contains the styles for AppComponent. You use this file when you want to define styles that only apply to a specific component, as opposed to your application overall.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A component in Angular is made up of three main partsâ€”the template, styles, and the class. For example, app.component.ts, app.component.html, and app.component.css together constitute the AppComponent. This structure separates the logic, view, and styles so that the application is more maintainable and scalable.</p>
        <p>In this way, you are using the best practices from the very beginning.</p>
        <p>The Angular CLI also generates a file for component testing called app.component.spec.ts, but this tutorial doesn't go into testing, so you can ignore that file.</p>
        <p>Whenever you generate a component, the CLI creates these four files in a directory with the name you specify.</p>

          <h3>The structure of an Angular application</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Angular is built with TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript meaning that any valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript. TypeScript offers typing and a more concise syntax than plain JavaScript, which gives you a tool for creating more maintainable code and minimizing bugs.</p>
        <p>Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. A component includes a TypeScript class that has a @Component() decorator.</p>

        </header>
        <p>That's it for your first introduction to Angular. At this point you should be set up and ready to build an Angular app, and have a basic understanding of how Angular works. In the next article we'll deepen that knowledge and start to build up the structure of our to-do list application.</p>
